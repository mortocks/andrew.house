While not really home automation, the Foobler is a smart dog toy that drops

## Design

The industrial design of this thing is rock solid. My dog April, though small plays really rough and has a very strong bit on her, however she bashes this thing around the apartment..

## The App

As much as I love this thing, the one major disappointment is the app. I'm an iOS app developer myself so you may think I would be judging the app too harshly but really, it's one of the worst I've ever seen. 
 
The layout of the app makes no sense. There is a bottom navigation bar which would typically be used navigate between the various area of the app but it also includes a back button which is weird.

The app also doesn't attempt to auto connect to the Foobler when you open it. Instead you have to click on the photo of your dog (which makes the image little bigger which means you've connected). 

Bad layout aside, the icons, fonts and colors are all hideous. 

I had some problems with the Foobler when an over the air update stopped the app from connecting to the device. I contacted the manufacturer (who were very helpful) and they put me in touch with the app developer. I can't say for sure but it looks like the Foobler team might have done the hardware and industrial design (which is top notch) but they outsourced the development to an overseas agency *(this is all unconfirmed and I may be completely wrong on this)*

I've started trying to reverse engineer the bluetooth commands to write my own app and to hook the Foobler into my [homebridge](https://github.com/steve228uk/homebridge-magichome) setup so I may post about this project at a later date. Seriously, if the Foolber manufacturers are reading this, I'd be interested in re-doing your app for you.
